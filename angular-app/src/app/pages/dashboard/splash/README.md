# Splash Page 
Splash page should be its own contained static webpage, since all it has is some markdown and some styling.

One issue with @Angular/material I have found is that it lacks many aesthetically please elements we may want to incorporate later on so that the page looks beautiful. Functionally though, Angular Material should accomplish the bare minimum.

### TODOs for the Default Splash Page:
1. Make it so stays minimalistic, yet rich on information about the services we will provide.
2. Choose a default color palette
3. Make a Google-sign in form
4. Add sections on the top bar like 'About Us', etc.
