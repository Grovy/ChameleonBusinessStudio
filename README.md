# Chameleon Business Studio

An open source scheduling application, usable and maintainable without an extensive Information
Technology department.

## Synopsis
Chameleon Business Studio aspires to adapt to its users, changing itself to "blend into" their needs until it supports their vital information systems. Our project provides an open-source scheduling application template that can be tailored to an individual or organizationâ€™s needs. After a brief configuration process, the application is usable "out of the box", with [Vendia](https://www.vendia.net/) providing data-layer hosting, perfect for individuals and organizers with little technical support.

## Application Screenshots

#### Admin panel page where the user can register a new user to the site. The form on the right is used to enter the new user's details and will appear on the table to the left when saved successfully.

#### Talen account dashboard. The talent account will have a widget that holds information about the event they have configured, in this case it is an Office Hour event with a link to its booking page. It also has a list of upcoming appointments that have been booked to this account.

## Setting up the application

TODO add instructions for setting environment variables

### Angular CLI

1. Make sure you have [Node.Js](https://nodejs.org/en/) installed in your local machine

2. At the time of cloning the repository, if you go to ChameleonBusinessStudio/angular-app and there is no directory called /node_modules
    
    1. First change directory to /angular-app
    2. Run the command `> npm i`
    3. You should see the /node_modules installed in the directory
    4. Run the command `> npm install -g @angular/cli` to install Angular CLI globally
    5. Lastly, install typescript by running the command `> npm install -g typescript`

3. By then, hopefully all the error messages are gone now

4. Also, since we will be using most of the styles and component from @Angular/material it is important that we import and make use of the UI Package

    1. Once everything is installed, go to `/angular-app/` directory
    2. run the command `> npm install --save @angular/material @angular/cdk`
    3. Double check that under `/angular-app/angular.json` in line 32, the first stylesheet Angular is using is `"./node_modules/@angular/material/prebuilt-themes/indigo-pink.css"`, if its not, then you can go ahead and copy and paste it as the first element of the json array.

## Launching the application

To run the application, you'll need to make sure your Angular App is built, if
not, navigate to the ```/angular-app``` directory and run

```gradle build```
 
once the Angular App is built, run spring via

```gradle bootRun```

You can now access the web application via ```http://localhost:8080```
For a list of application routes, check out [routes.txt](./docs/routes.txt)

## API Documentation

While the app is running, you can view its documentation at http://localhost:8080/webjars/swagger-ui/index.html

## Testing

You can verify the application works using unit-tests and integration tests. For
more information, see our testing document: [System Test Manual](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1mtnvVTMj3DmtRkPomzXweAng4owOAyAM/view?usp=share_link)

### Unit Tests

You can run unit tests using the command `gradle test` or `./gradlew test`.
These tests are very fast, and check if each component works as intended.

### Integration Tests

You can run integration tests using the command `gradle integration` or `./gradlew integration`.
Note that these tests are very thurough, but are also slow.

## Known Issues

- Since the app stores some configuration information on the local file system,
  it will not work on distributed systems, so it needs a single host machine.

## Misc

- The application stores website configuration information in your home folder,
  or the folder set by the `CHAMELEON_HOME` environment variable,
  in a folder named ```ChameleonBusinessStudio```
